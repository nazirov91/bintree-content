## Set Operations
Frequently we need to combine sets to produce new sets. For instance, say we have a set of animals that live under the water and another set of animals that live on the ground. We could make a new set of animals that can live both, under water and on the ground. Or a set of animals that cannot live in water. 
There are a few ways of combining sets.

***1. Intersections***
Let's say that we have a set *A* = {1,2,3} and set *B* = {2,3,4}. **Intersection** of *A* and *B* is a new set - {2,3}. In other words, intersection is a set of objects that are present in multiple sets at the same time. In symbols, intersection is denoted by $\cap$.  
* {1,2,3} $\cap$ {2,3,4} = {2,3}

If two sets have no simultaneous objects, they are said to be **disjoint sets**.

Sometimes it is helpful to visualize sets to get the big picture. To do that we implement **Venn Diagrams**.
